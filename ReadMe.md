## **API**


## Documentation

Documentation in the form of a postman collection for the api is located in `documentation/api`

## Restarting the API

- Windows
  docker-compose down; cls; docker-compose up --build
- Linux
  docker-compose down; reset; docker-compose up --build

## **Postgres**

### **Starting up development environment**

Please note that the first time `docker-compose up` is run it will error out and have to be re-run this is because the database has to be created and the api depends on the db creation to finish.
